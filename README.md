# VOTP (Validation OTP)
VOTP is a robust web application developed with Spring Boot, designed to generate and validate One-Time Passwords (OTP) using REST APIs. This project offers high scalability by leveraging Redis caching (when the profile is enabled) to efficiently manage OTP storage and retrieval.
